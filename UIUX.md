1. Consistency:

   Ensure elements (colors, fonts, buttons, etc.) across the application remain consistent. Use high-contrast colors, provide text descriptions for images, and ensure keyboard accessibility.

2. Navigation:

   Offer clear navigation paths, ensuring users can easily find the information they seek. Use explicit buttons and navigation elements, guiding users on how to browse the app.
